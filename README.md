## Project Overview
This is a simple CLI (Command-Line-Interface) game. The user will be able to see a question, choose one of the given options(index only), and a message will show to reveal if the answer was correct. When all questions are answered, the final score of correct percentage and duration will be displayed at the end of the round. As well as the index of the questions that was answered wrong so user can go back to review.
